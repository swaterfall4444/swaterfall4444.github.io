### Code Review

Before Exploring my code, check out my [code review](https://youtu.be/w8wvmomElyM) that goes over the projects prior to my updates.

### Family Tree App

View the [layout and source code files](https://github.com/swaterfall4444/swaterfall4444.github.io/tree/swaterfall4444-Software-Design-and-Engineering) for this Android App
To set up this app, run the build.gradle file in Android Studio

### Animal Monitoring System
View the code for this app [here](https://github.com/swaterfall4444/swaterfall4444.github.io/tree/swaterfall4444-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures)
To run this app, import all files into a new Java Project and you will be able to view, create, update and delete information in both of the text files

### Mongo Database REST API
For this last project I had created a RESTful API using Bottle Rest Service and pyMongo.
The Server file and example cURL requests can be found [here] (https://github.com/swaterfall4444/swaterfall4444.github.io/tree/swaterfall4444-Databases-Code)
The Mongo Database was hosted on Codio and as such will not be permanently available, however feel free to see the coding structure of the server that I had created.
